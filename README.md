# Documentation

This is a forked repository to experiment with React SignalR integration into existing C# projects, under different environments and constraints.
Future edits relevant to the scope of work will be on a private repository, so this will not be updated. 
This, however, serves as a raw working POC that React SignalR integration is possible into an existing C# .NET project.
